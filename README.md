# XtGRL
Extended textual Goal-oriented Requirements Language is the extended edition of tGRL that is a domain specific language defined over DSL grammar in Xtext. Xtext is an open source Eclipse plugin. We have extended (also reduced) the tGRL grammar to enable only those features that allow enterprise architects to specify only the functional requirements and the corresponding non-functional requirements that are desired to be satisficed.
Extensions are described in followings.
